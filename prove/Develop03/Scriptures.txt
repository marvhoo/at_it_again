Jarom|1|3|4|Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears,\n and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the face of the land. And there are many among us who have many revelations, for they are not all stiffnecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked and have faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.

Ecclesiastes|1|2|4|Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is bvanity. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the aearth abideth for ever.
